        The Snouts are a five-piece melodic punk band from Meanjin (Brisbane), delivering fast, hook-driven skate punk with ska energy and triple-vocal harmonies. Drawing on the grit of Propagandhi and the melodic punch of NOFX and Lagwagon, their sound is built for loud rooms and touring bills.

        Their 2024 single <a href="https://thesnouts1.bandcamp.com/track/it-is-what-it-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-brand-primary/90 underline hover:text-brand-primary transition-colors"><em>It Is What It Is</em></a> landed at #17 in 4ZZZ's Hot 100, following consecutive chart placements in 2021 (<a href="https://thesnouts1.bandcamp.com/track/5-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-brand-primary/90 underline hover:text-brand-primary transition-colors"><em>5 Times</em></a> - #24) and 2022 — marking steady growth in Brisbane's independent scene. Featuring former members of Fire Away! and Brisbane City All Skas, The Snouts combine technical tightness with crowd-lifting choruses that land quickly in a 30–40 minute set.
